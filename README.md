# Salary_Prediction_system

This project is aimed at predicting the average estimated salary of the candidate based on his experience and job skills. This is an end to end model, starting from scrapping of data from glassdoor website to the deployment and making of web app using streamlit.

Note: - scrapped data(of the different cities in america) is stored in a .csv file. 
        The .p file i.e. pickled file is then used to make the web app.
        ML techinquies like linear regression, lasso regression, decision tree, Random forest is appiled for model building.
        You can find the Python script(app.py) for the web app in the same repo.
        Finally, to run the web app, just open your command prompt and install streamlit using pip install streamlit and then write streamlit run app.py
